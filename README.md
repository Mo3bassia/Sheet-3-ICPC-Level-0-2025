# ICPC Damanhour Level 0 - Week 3 - 2025 üèÜ

Welcome to my Week 3 journey! üéâ

## Overview üìù

This week, I explored loops in C++, a crucial concept for repetitive tasks in programming. I learned how to use different types of loops (for, while, do-while) to efficiently handle iterations and solve complex problems. Through these problems, I discovered how to control program flow using loop control statements like break and continue, and how to implement nested loops for more sophisticated solutions.

## Problems & Solutions üí°

This repository contains my solutions to various competitive programming problems, each demonstrating different applications of loops and iteration techniques.

## Learning Objectives üìö

- Practice problem-solving skills
- Improve algorithmic thinking
- Enhance coding efficiency
- Prepare for competitive programming challenges

## What I Learned üìù

This problem sheet helped me master different types of loops in C++:

### Loops Mastery üîÑ
- **For Loops**: Used in problems like "Wrong Subtraction" and "Vanya and Cubes" for precise iteration control
- **While Loops**: Applied in "Bear and Big Brother" for condition-based iterations
- **Nested Loops**: Practiced in "Beautiful Matrix" and "Team" for 2D array manipulation
- **Do-While Loops**: Used in special cases where we need to execute the code at least once

### Problem-Solving Skills üß†
