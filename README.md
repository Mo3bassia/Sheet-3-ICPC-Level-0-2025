## Learning Objectives üìö

- Practice problem-solving skills
- Improve algorithmic thinking
- Enhance coding efficiency
- Prepare for competitive programming challenges

## What I Learned üìù

This problem sheet helped me master different types of loops in C++:

### Loops Mastery üîÑ
- **For Loops**: Used in problems like "Wrong Subtraction" and "Vanya and Cubes" for precise iteration control
- **While Loops**: Applied in "Bear and Big Brother" for condition-based iterations
- **Nested Loops**: Practiced in "Beautiful Matrix" and "Team" for 2D array manipulation
- **Do-While Loops**: Used in special cases where we need to execute the code at least once

### Problem-Solving Skills üß†
- Breaking down complex problems into smaller steps
- Choosing the right loop type for different scenarios
- Optimizing loop conditions for better performance
- Understanding when to break or continue in loops
